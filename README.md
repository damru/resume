# Resume

![](https://github.com/damru/resume/workflows/Resume%20Pipeline/badge.svg)

There are plenty of platforms in the wild to host your resume, and make it look beautiful. But I like to get the job done, especially if I learn something on the way.

So, here, you will find the code behind the [resume](http://cv.damienrubio.com).

# Behind the curtains

This resume is crafted with :heart:

:rainbow: It's built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),

:rocket: powered by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/),

:cloud: and hosted on a bare metal [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster running on [Talos](https://www.talos.dev/) through [proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/).
